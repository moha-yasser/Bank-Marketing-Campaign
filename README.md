# Bank-Marketing-Campaign
An end-to-end banking marketing prediction pipeline using SQL for deduplication and feature engineering, and Python (Gradient Boosting/LightGBM) to handle imbalanced data and predict term deposit subscriptions.

## 📊 Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing (UCI) dataset, sourced from Kaggle.
- Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing
- Description: This dataset contains 41,188 rows representing direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on a Portuguese marketing campaign. The workflow is split into two distinct phases:
- SQL-based Data Engineering: Focusing on data integrity, cleaning, and creating new domain-specific metrics.
- Python-based Modeling: Utilizing automated pipelines and specialized techniques to handle class imbalance and feature selection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Database: MySQL Workbench
- Environment: Visual Studio Code (Jupyter notebook)
- Libraries: SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM

## 🗄️ Phase 1: Data Engineering (MySQL Workbench)
I performed the initial heavy lifting in SQL to ensure the dataset was clean and augmented with meaningful features before any modeling took place.

### 🛡️ Data Preservation & Staging
Multi-Stage Backups: I implemented a staging workflow by creating bank_additional_staging and bank_additional_staging2 to perform transformations while keeping the original source data untouched.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Quality Audit
- Deduplication: Identified and removed duplicate records by partitioning over 20 unique features using ROW_NUMBER().
- Standardization: Conducted a quality audit using SELECT DISTINCT and LENGTH() to find spelling inconsistencies.
- Uniform Casing: Standardized all categorical columns (Job, Marital, Education, etc.) to lowercase using LOWER() to ensure consistent grouping.

### 🧪 Feature Engineering
I engineered several composite features to provide stronger signals for the models:
- financial_stress: A sum of credit default, housing, and personal loan status (mapped to 1 if 'yes') to measure total debt burden.
- economic_index: A composite score of employment variation rate, consumer confidence, and the euribor 3-month rate.
- contact_intensity: Sum of campaign and previous contacts to track total engagement.
- unknown_count: A flag identifying profiles with missing financial data in the source.

## 🐍 Phase 2: Python Modeling (VS Code)
The modeling phase focused on reproducibility and addressing the significant class imbalance in the target variable.

## ⚖️ Handling Imbalanced Data
The target variable was highly imbalanced (32,717 'No' vs 2,262 'Yes'). To ensure the model learned to identify the minority class effectively:
- Class Weights: Utilized class_weight='balanced' in the models to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily.
- Scoring Metric: Used F1-Score as the primary metric for permutation_importance to ensure feature selection favored a balance between Precision and Recall rather than simple Accuracy.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipelines
I built two separate pipelines to automate preprocessing and prevent data leakage:

1. Gradient Boosting (pipe_gb)
Stages: One-Hot Encoding for temporal features (month, day_of_week) followed by the Gradient Boosting classifier.
Optimization: Used permutation_importance to isolate a specific list of important_features and re-fitted the model for better generalization.

2. LightGBM (pipe_lgb)
Categorical Handling: Leveraged LightGBM's native capability to process categorical features. I converted the relevant columns to the category Dtype in a loop before training.
Optimization: Applied the same permutation importance logic to refine the feature set and re-fitted the model.

📊 Summary of Results
Integrated Workflow: Successfully connected VS Code to MySQL via SQLAlchemy to stream engineered features into the ML pipeline.

Feature Importance: By using permutation importance with an F1-scoring focus, I identified which variables (including the SQL-engineered composite features) truly drive term deposit subscriptions despite the class imbalance.
